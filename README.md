# exploring-apis
Repository for sample data, api access methods and initial prototypes

This repository is intended to hold initial explorations of possible 
data sources for the Future Bus Stops / Local Connections group
digital visualisation project.

Each data source should have its own top-level folder here, which might
contain sample code to make API requests, small samples of data, and 
initial visualisations.
