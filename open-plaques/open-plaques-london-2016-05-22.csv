40694,"Chiswick Park station  Listed as a building of National Significance  Architect: Charles Holden, 1933  The station first opened on 1 July 1879 by the Metroploitan District Railway when the railway was extended from Turnham Green to Ealing Broadway.  The station was originally named 'Acton Green' and was renamed to 'Chiswick Park' on 1 March 1910.  The original station was demolished in 1931 to accommodate the new Piccadilly line tracks, although the Piccadilly line has never served this station, and the new building opened in 1933.  The new station was designed by Charles Holden in a modern European style using brick, reinforced concrete and glass.  Similar to the station at Arnos Grove that Holden designed for the eastern Piccadilly line extension, the station's predominant feature is the tall semi-circular ticket hall.  Externally the brick walls of the ticket hall are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped with a flat concrete slab roof.  To make the station's location visible from Chiswick High Road the station was also provided with a square brick tower surmounted by the roundel and the stations name.  The ticket hall once housed a central passimeter, whcih has now been replaced with the brick built ticket office accommodation which has altered the appearance of the grandiose hall.  The station was Grade II listed on 18 February 1987.",51.4943,-0.26761,United Kingdom,London,"",http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5747/23667511169_f81d457671_z.jpg,brown,"[""London Underground""]","",,1,Charles Holden,,,man,[],https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Holden,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Holden,"","[""Charles Holden||man||""]"

40776,"Clarion House stands on an historic site in St Anne's Court which passed from the crown to the Duke of Portland in the 17th century. For two centuries the court was a haven for political refugees from France and Switzerland and, in modern times, from Eastern Europe. The historic houses were demolished in 1967 but in the 1980's the site was brought back into housing use for local people by the Soho Housing Association. Clarion House was opened on 24th June 1987 by the Hon. Peter Brooke MP.

11713,"Admiral Thomas Hardy
05 April 1769 - 20 September 1839

Hardy was born on 5th April 1769 in Portisham, Dorset.
He first entered the navy in 1781 on board the brig, HMS Helena.
He remained with the ship for a short period after which, in 1782,
he left the navy to attend school for three years. He joined the merchant
navy for some years and in 1790, decided to rejoin the Royal Navy. His
first appointment as midshipman was with HMS Hebe. He was later transferred
to the sloop, HMS Tisphone, and followed the Captain, Anthony Hunt, when he 
was transferred to HMS Amphitrite in 1793.
In November of that year, he was promoted to Lieutenant and appointed to HMS
Meleager. This ship was part of a squadron off the coast of Genoa under the 
command of Captain Horatio Nelson. In August 1796, Hardy transferred to HMS
Minerve with Captain Cockburn. At the end of the year, Nelson transferred to
the Sabina, Hardy, along with Lieutenant Culverhouse, was in charge of a boarding
party sent to claim her as a prize after her capture. They managed to draw off
the rest of the Spanish squadron, but the ship was later re-captured after
one of her masts was destroyed and Hardy was taken prisoner along with the rest
of the boarding party.

He was later repatriated with the Minerve at Gibraltar after an exchange of 
prisoners, which included the Captain of the Sabina. Captain Nelson was warm
in praise of the actions of his lieutenants in this action.
Shortly after rejoining his ship, Hardy was nearly captured again by the 
Spanish when he jumped overboard to save a seaman who was drowning after 
falling out of one of the boats. The current had carried them towards the lead
ship of the Spanish squadron in the Gibraltar Straits. Nelson took instant action
by ordering shorten their sail and stand off. Hardy and the seaman were
rescued. A few days later, the ship had joined the British fleet and took part
in the battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797.
In the following Maym HMSs Minerve and Lively were patrolling around the bay of
Santa Cruz and found a French brig, the Mutine. On the 29th, longboats
from the two ships were sent to capture it under Hardy's command. It
was successful and Hardy was appointed to command of the prize by Admiral
Jervis. He also was promoted to Commander.

Hardy went to the Mediterranean with Nelson, who had been appointed Commander
in Chief. In July 1803, Nelson transferred to HMS Victory and Hardy joined him to 
resume his position as Flag Captain.During the following months and years, the
ship was kept busy with the blockade of Toulon and continuing pursuit of the 
Franco-Spanish fleet across the Atlantic. Hardy, along with Captain Blackwood,
witnessed Nelson's last will and during the battle of Trafalgar on 
October 21st 1805, was walking along side his Commander in chief when a 
French spiner fatally shot Nelson. As Nelson's Chief of Staff, he remained
on duty during the remainder of the battle while keeping his dying friend
and Commabder informed of the proceedings. In recognition for these
services, he was created a baronet. He played a major part in the state
funeral of Nelson on 9 January 1806 at St Paul's Cathedral.

Hardy was decorated as a Knight Commander of the Order of Bath in
January 1815 and returned to Britain in June of that year. On his return,
he was appointed to command the Royal Yacht Princess Augusta. He served
on her for three years. In August 1819, he was promoted to Commodore and
appointed as Commander in Chief for the South American station. He
transferred his flag to HMS Superb and his services during the war of
independence that was being fought in the former Spanish colonies won
him praise from the Admiralty. He eventually returned to Britain in 1824.

In 1830, he was appointed as First Sea Lord at the Admiralty. He
retained this post until 1834. During this period, he was appointed
as Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Bath. At the end of his period
as First Sea Lord, he was appointed as Governor of Greenwich Hospital.
During his time as Governor, he introduced many changes to improve the lives
of the pensioners. He was promoted as Vice Admiral in January 1837.
Hardy died on 20th September 1839 and was buried in the mausoleum in the 
grounds of Greenwich Hospital. His wife and daughters survived him, but
as he had no male heirs, his baronetcy became extinct.",51.48202,-0.00921,United Kingdom,London,"",http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8044/8117180013_c2e35ffbe9_z.jpg,black,[],"",,1,Thomas Hardy,1769,1839,man,"[""Captain of the Fleet"", ""First Sea Lord"", ""witness to Nelson's immortal dying words"", ""Admiral"", ""Governor of Greenwich Hospital"", ""Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath"", ""Baronet"", ""First Naval Lord of the British Navy""]","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Thomas_Hardy,_1st_Baronet","http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sir_Thomas_Hardy,_1st_Baronet",https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Thomas_Hardy_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_16914.jpg?width=640,"[""Thomas Hardy|(1769-1839)|man|Captain of the Fleet, First Sea Lord, witness to Nelson's immortal dying words, Admiral, Governor of Greenwich Hospital, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, Baronet, and First Naval Lord of the British Navy|""]"

11722,"The Bradley Meridian

The first British National Meridian

The Greenwich Meridian was set according to the
location of the telescope used by the Astronomer
Royal to establish time. Between 1750 and 1850, the
Greenwich Meridian was marked by the north-south line
running through the Transit Instrument first used
by James Bradley, the 3rd Astronomer Royal (1742-62).

The Bradley Meridian served as Longitude 0° for all of
the earliest Ordnance Survey maps of England.

When the Airy Transit Circle Telescope was erected in
1850, the Greenwich Meridian was moved 
approximately 19 ft east to its present location. This
move equals only 1/50th of a second of time - a
quantity too small for ninteenth-century astronomers
to measure.",51.47768,-0.00147,United Kingdom,London,"",http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8475/8128796587_acf9cc062c_z.jpg,black,"[""Royal Museums Greenwich""]","",,2,The Bradley Meridian,1750,1850,man,"[""British National Meridian""]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bradley_Meridian,http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Bradley_Meridian,"","[""The Bradley Meridian|(1750-1850)|man|British National Meridian|"", ""James Bradley|(1693-1762)|man|astronomer and Astronomer Royal|""]"

12733,"In front of you is the oldest gothic church in London, rebuilt in 1212 after a fire severely damaged the Norman church. The site has been a place of worship for 1,400 years. First as a Saxon convent, thought to have been founded in 606, it became the Priory of St. Mary for Augustinian canons in 1106. The canons established the famous hospital of St. Thomas that was moved to Lambeth in the 19th century. After the dissolution of the monastery in 1539 the Priory Church became the Parish Church of St. Saviour, in the Diocese of Winchester. In 1905 it was made a Cathedral with its own diocese, to serve the spiritual and material needs of south London's growing population. 

In monastic times the parish church was in the Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene formerly on the south side of the chancel (to your left) but demolished in 1822 during restoration work on the choir. You are looking down at the East Churchyard which contains the foundations of the 14th-century Lady Chapel and Bishop Andrewes' burial chapel. There also used to be houses built right up to the church. All these were demolished in the 1830s to make way for the approach road to John Rennie's new London Bridge.

Known for many years as the 'Lord Wellington' it is still frequently referred to as the 'Welly Bar' by many of the academics and local residents. Renamed in October 1982 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the death of Jeremy Bentham who is recognised as the spiritual founder of University College London. The myth that he was the founder is sustained in a bizarre manner by the college.
His 'Auto-Icon' as he called it, is in fact his skeleton, dressed in his own clothes and topped with a wax model of his head.
His actual head is mummified and kept in the college vaults. It is brought out for meetings of the college council and he is recorded as being present but not voting. Above the bar can be seen a copy of the wax head, made by students at the college In renaming the pub after him we are reminded of his greatest ideal, ""The greatest happiness of the greatest numbers.""

9880,"Air Chief Marshall Lord Dowding was Commander-in-Chief of Fighter Command, Royal Air Force from its formation in 1936 until November 1940. He was thus responsible for the preparation for and the conduct of the Battle of Britain.

With remarkable foresight he ensured the equipment of his command with monoplane fighters, the Hurricane and the Spitfire. He was among the first to appreciate the vital importance of R.D.F (Radar) and of an effective command and control system for his squadrons. They were ready when war came.

In the preliminary stages of that war, he thoroughly trained  his minimal forces and conserved them against strong political pressures to disperse an misuse them. His wise and prudent judgement and leadership helped to ensure victory against overwhelming odds and thus prevented  the loss of the Battle of Britain and probably the whole war.

To him the people of Britain and of the free world owe largely the way of life and liberties they enjoy today.

41034,"Sudbury Hill station   Listed as a building of National Significance   Architect: Adams, Holden & Pearson Partners, 1932
The original station opened on 28 June 1903 on the Metropolitan District Railway extension from Ealing Common to South Harrow.  It was rebuilt in preparation of the transfer of services to the Piccadilly line on 4 July 1932.
This new extension was, together with the existing tracks back to Acton Town, the first experimental section of the Underground’s surface lines to be electrified and operated electric instead of steam trains.
Sudbury Hill was to see the full development of the format and style Charles Holden had designed as Sudbury Town station in 1931, which he was to use for the majority of Underground stations during the 1930s.  The main structure consists of a red brick ‘box’, topped with a flat concrete roof.  The high ticket hall is illuminated by a large vertical window within each facade and an Underground roundel, with original graphics, is inset into the glazing above the entrance.  The design of the rest of the building deliberately integrates the overbridge, staircases to platforms and the waiting room accommodation into the overall architectural idiom.
The station still remains much of the original decor with the use of timber and bronze finishes for seats, poster frames and telephone booths.  However, the original passimeter (ticket booth) has since been replaced by a modern ticketing system.",51.55852,-0.33542,United Kingdom,London,"",http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1524/25475769521_6d894bb072_z.jpg,brown,"[""Transport for London""]","",,1,Charles Holden,,,man,[],https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Holden,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Holden,"","[""Charles Holden||man||""]"

41035,"Sudbury Town station   Listed building of National Significance   Architect: Adams, Holden & Pearson Partners, 1932
The original station opened on 28 June 1903 on the Metropolitan District Railway extension from Ealing Common to South Harrow.  It was rebuilt in preparation of the transfer of services to the Piccadilly line on 4 July 1932.
Sudbury Town seen as one of the seminal works of the architect Charles Holden and as such it set many of the elements for the other Underground stations he was to design in the 1930s.  It saw the move away from the use of Portland stone, as had been seen on his previous designs for stations such as Ealing Common, towards a more European idiom based on unadorned concrete and brick that was a real change in British architecture of the day.  It is viewed by many many as being one of Britain’s best buildings of the time.
The main structure consists of a red Buckinghamshire brisk ‘box’, flanked by single storey extension and all topped by concrete flat roof.  Each facade is punctuated by a large vertical window that allows natural daylight to flood in and at night, be illuminated - making the building, as intended, a beacon in suburbia.  The design also integrates the overbridge and other buildings.  The ticket hall still retains much of the original decor including the timber passimeter and, on the platforms, the original designs for concrete fencing and lampposts are still used.  Some of the signs on the station make use of the rare, serrifed variation of the traditional Underground Johnstone typeface.",51.55084,-0.31559,United Kingdom,London,"",http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1502/24939310114_62dc4b5815_z.jpg,brown,"[""Transport for London""]","",,1,Charles Holden,,,man,[],https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Holden,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Holden,"","[""Charles Holden||man||""]"

This is the site of the Great Exhibition of 1851. It was the first world exhibition of design, technology and innovation, displaying exhibits from Britain, the British Empire and the rest of the world.

For the first time, the site in Hyde Park has been marked. Five recycled glass and concrete plaques now stand on the footprint and former entrance to the building. Early examples of the materials and techniques used in this project were displayed in the Great Exhibition. This public art project commemorates the 160th anniversary of the Great Exhibition.

Designed by Joseph Paxton, the Great Exhibition building was nicknamed the 'Crystal Palace'. It was the world's first large-scale prefabricated building. Measuring 1848ft by 108ft, the spectacular structure was built using glass and iron. From where you are standing, it would have spanned roughly 924ft (281 metres) to your left and right.

The exhibition presented over 100,000 exhibits, including a black diamond from Brazil, a barometer using leeches, a prototype submarine. Smith & Weston rifles and edible birds nests from Java. The legacy of the Great Exhibition continues to this day.

The Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 staged the landmark project.

41098,"The Soldiers Return name came from the days when soldiers would return to the nearby RAF base to convalesce after active service.  RAF Uxbridge occupies the former estate and grounds of the historic Hillingdon House and has an important connection with Britain's air defence during the World War II.  The original Hillingdon House is thought to have been built in 1617 and was rebuilt in 1717 by the last Duke of Schonberg.  Prior to 1717, the estate had been identified as belonging partly to the manor of Swakeleys and partly to the Manor of Colham.  A Medieval settlement within this area was concentrated within te settlements of Hillingdon, Colham and Uxbridge and it is likely that the site lay within common land and wasteland between these.  The current Hillingdon House was rebuilt in 1844 after being destroyed by fire.  In 1907 the gardens covered 47 acres and contained a five-acre lake formed by a dam in the River Pinn.  The park as a while covered approximatley 158 acres with no significant changes by 1914.  The estate was bought by the Government in 1918 an used as a convalescence home for Canadian soldiers after which it became the RFC Armanent and Gunnery School.  In 1919 the RAF Depot relocated from Halton to the site and became the main recruit-training centre.  During the 1920's new barrack blocks around a large parade ground and other buildings were built to accommodate this.  Hillongdon House soon began to house headquarters for units, of which the most notable was No 11 (Fighter) Group who were there from 1936.",51.5681,-0.44094,United Kingdom,London,"",http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1629/26151528076_998a7c22fa_z.jpg,blue,[],"",,2,Hillingdon Hall,,,man,[],https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillingdon_Hall,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hillingdon_Hall,"","[""Hillingdon Hall||man||"", ""Hillingdon House||man||""]"

On Monday 21st October 1805 the Royal Navy decisively defeated a combined French and Spanish fleet off Cape Trafalgar south of Cadiz. This victory permanently removed the threat of invasion of England by the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte.
The first official dispatches with news of the victory, and the death of Vice Admiral Lord Nelson, were carried to England on board H.M. Schooner PICKLE by her captain, Lieutenant John Richards Lapenotiere.
Lapenotiere landed at Falmouth on Monday 4th November 1805 and set out by post-chaise for London, covering the 271 miles in 37 hours.
He drove past this point shortly before one in the morning of Wednesday 6th and turned down Whitehall to reach the Admiralty where he delivered the despatches to the Secretary to the Board with the words,
""Sir, we have won a great victory, but have lost Lord Nelson.""

39235,"Heritage Information  Cockfosters station  Listed as a building of National Significance  Architect: Charles Holden, 1933  The station opened in the then small hamlet of Cockfosters on 31 July 1933, the last of the stations on the extension of the line from Finsbury Park.  The station was to be a focal point for a new suburb and although some development took place, areas to the north and east of the station became part of the protected London Green Belt.  The station building is a low European style brick structure flanked by two small towers each with a pole mounted roundel.  The alignment of road and rail approaches was developed to produce a ticket hall concourse of pentagonal plan.  Reinforced concrete was used for the entire concourse and train shed.  At the time, the use of such materials, unadorned, was viewed as a modernistic approach to buildings in this country.  The station is located in a 'cutting' and required natural light to enter from above, so the roof was built in two levels with inclined celestory (sic) windows run-in the full length terminating in an apex above the concourse.  Other noteworthy elements of the station include the predominant use of bronze framed signs and windows, the original passimeter, rectangular train describer box with integral clock and the timber seats.  This station, along with adjoining stations on the Piccadilly line, are now internationally recognised as being some of the finest examples of 1930's architecture designed by Holden and Partners.  The station was grade II listed in May 1987.",51.6516,-0.14953,United Kingdom,London,"",http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7627/16677868059_0cbcdfe4e1_z.jpg,brown,"[""London Underground""]","",,1,Charles Holden,,,man,[],https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Holden,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Holden,"","[""Charles Holden||man||""]"
