      "text": "It is many years since planning scholarship, via an engagement with feminism and an acknowledgement of multiculturalism, made its important critique of ‘the public’, in whose interests planning was said to occur.  The heterogeneity of that public was claimed, and indeed the existence of multiple publics. This was planning with the social in mind, drawing our attention to the various ways of planning for the company of strangers in the city.  Recent developments in urban thought have highlighted interactions across difference in the city, rather than solely the separate existence of identified groups in their diversity.  With this new thinking, a conceptual apparatus is emerging for planning the social that emphasises what urban dwellers have in common, as expressed in their encounters and their use of shared urban activities and resources. This talk considers whether a new understanding of publics can emerge that protects our recognition of difference even as it focuses on shared experiences, and whether the concept of diversity has strength enough to support this. \n  \nSpeaker: \nRuth Fincher is Redmond Barry Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Melbourne.  She has held the Chairs of Urban Planning (1997 – 2006) and Geography (2007-2015) at the University of Melbourne.  She is a Board member of the International Social Science Council and a past Vice President of the International Geographical Union. \nAn urban geographer with research and teaching interests in the urban outcomes of immigration and multiculturalism, diversity and difference in cities, inequality and locational disadvantage, Professor Fincher is widely published internationally and has supervised many PhD students. Her writings include the books Planning and Diversity in the City: Redistribution, Recognition and Encounter, co-authored with Kurt Iveson (Palgrave Macmillan, London. 2008). Creating Unequal Futures?  Rethinking Inequality, Poverty and Disadvantage (Allen and Unwin, Sydney, 2001) co-edited with Peter Saunders, Australian Poverty: Then and Now (Melbourne University Press, 1998) co-edited with John Nieuwenhuysen, and Cities of Difference (Guilford Press, New York, 1998) co-edited with Jane Jacobs. International journals in which she has published recently include Social and Cultural Geography, Geoforum, Progress in Planning  and Geographical Research. \nShe is a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia, a Distinguished Fellow of the Institute of Australian Geographers, and in January 2014 was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM). \n  \nThe Bartlett School of Planning Public Lecture Series is supported by Capita’s property and infrastructure business, a leading multidisciplinary consultancy that provides real estate, design, project delivery, infrastructure, and business transformation services. www.capita.co.uk/property "

Writer and academic Dr Preti Taneja will introduce the event, followed by a Q&A chaired by Film London Head of Talent Development and Production, Deborah Sathe. Come and meet Kurban Kassan (producer, Cinestaan), Briony Hanson (Head of Film, British Council) and Tessa Inkelaar (VP International Development Cinestaan), find out about the film's ambitions and the place of Shakespeare on film in India-British relations. Hear more about the Microwave International production scheme and the development process which led to Film London and the British Council working with Cinestaan on this exciting UK/India co-production. \n15:15 – 16:45  \nScreening - 10 ml Love: Indian Midsummer Night’s Dream Shakespeare goes indie   \nThe young and upcoming director, Sharat Katariya, transforms Shakespeare’s most popular play according to the edgy Indian indie aesthetics. This 2012 romcom moves from the magical forest setting of A Midsummer Night’s Dream to the urban jungle of Mumbai where Oberon and Titania are aphrodisiac sellers. Like the original though expect lots of humour and love triangles. \n29th April 13:00 – 15:45  \nScreening: Kaliyattam \nFirst shown in 1997, this acclaimed adaptation of Shakespeare's Othello revolves around Kannan Perumalayan, a Theyyam artist who parallels Othello, and Thamara, the beautiful daughter of a village head in Kerala. The film went on to scoop up Best Actor for Suresh Gopi (Kannan) and Best Director for Jayaraaj at India’s National Film Awards. We will be joined by Jayaraaj, who will take part in a Q&A at the film’s end, led by Thea Buckley. \n  "

In recent years he has focused on governance and ethical issues and has participated in a number of significant investigations and risk assessments around the world, including Norton Rose Fulbright’s advice to the Board of TeliaSonera AB in relation to certain of its Eurasian investments. He has advised on ethical implications of a number of M&A transactions. Robin is a member of the Law Society of England and Wales and the City of London Solicitors’ Company. Recently he has been involved in the development of Norton Rose Fulbright's training in relation to M&A and in particular training for transactions involving difficult jurisdictions with a particular focus on human rights related issues. He regularly talks on ethical issues relating to international transactions and is a keen supporter of organisations dedicated to the support for Human Rights.   \nAbout the Centre: \nUCL Centre for Ethics & Law was established in 2009 to reflect the growing need for enhanced collaboration between academics, practicing lawyers and industry, given the fast changing and increasingly interdisciplinary nature of the global issues lying at the intersection between ethics and regulatory compliance. The work of the Centre is resolutely multi-disciplinary and practice-oriented, focusing on a number of current themes including the professional ethics of in-house and external legal counsel, ethics of risk, anti-corruption, global business and human rights, and distributive justice.
