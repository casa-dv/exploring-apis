The first will be on 18 April 2016, 2-4. More information \nJacques Lacan located the origin of his key notion of plus-de-jouir (surplus-enjoyment) in Marx’s notion of surplus-value, and it is worth exploring in detail the homology of the two notions, adding a third one, that of surplus-knowledge, a pseudo-knowledge in the guise of which our ignorance appears (“supreme” knowledge of God and other hidden forces, conspiracy theories, etc.). Such an analysis is crucial for resuscitating Marx’s critique of political economy, as well as for properly understanding today’s global capitalism and its ideological effects, up to fundamentalist violence.     \nRecommended reading:  \nSlavoj Žižek, 'The Return of the Critique of Political Economy' in Living in the End of Times (Verso 2010). \nSamo Tomšič, The Capitalist Unconscious (Verso Books 2015) ",

    "end": "2016-05-12T19:00:00",
    "description": "How did so many of us, Homo sapiens, quite late in our species history, come to live in sedentary heaps of people, grain, and domesticated animals and governed by units we call states? And what was the relationship between these polities and those remained outside their control? The earliest agrarian states were small and fragile. More people lived outside them than within. They were subject to internal fracture, abandonment, and raiding—both sporadic and systematic. They also represented valuable trade depots that enhanced the exchange value of products from non-state ecologies. The result was, for a time at least, what one might call a “golden age of barbarians.” \nJames C. Scott is the Sterling Professor of Political Science and Professor of Anthropology and is Director of the Agrarian Studies Program at Yale University. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, has held grants from the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Guggenheim Foundation, and has been a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Science, Science, Technology and Society Program at M.I.T., and the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. \nHis research concerns political economy, comparative agrarian societies, theories of hegemony and resistance, peasant politics, revolution, Southeast Asia, theories of class relations and anarchism. He is currently teaching Agrarian Studies and Rebellion, Resistance and Repression. \nRecent publications include “Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed”, Yale University Press, 1997; “Geographies of Trust: Geographies of Hierarchy,” in Democracy and Trust, 1998; “State Simplifications and Practical Knowledge,” in People’s Economy, People’s Ecology, 1998 and “The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist  History of Upland Southeast Asia” (Yale  Press, 2009). \nThis Centenary Lecture will be followed by a drinks reception. \n  \nFAQs \n What are my transport/parking options getting to the event? \nPublic transport is advised.  Russell Square tube station on the Picadilly line is less than five minutes walk away. \n Where can I contact the organiser with any questions? \nDr. Michael Buehler, email; mb107@soas.ac.uk \n  ",

    "description": "It is many years since planning scholarship, via an engagement with feminism and an acknowledgement of multiculturalism, made its important critique of ‘the public’, in whose interests planning was said to occur.  The heterogeneity of that public was claimed, and indeed the existence of multiple publics. This was planning with the social in mind, drawing our attention to the various ways of planning for the company of strangers in the city.  Recent developments in urban thought have highlighted interactions across difference in the city, rather than solely the separate existence of identified groups in their diversity.  With this new thinking, a conceptual apparatus is emerging for planning the social that emphasises what urban dwellers have in common, as expressed in their encounters and their use of shared urban activities and resources. This talk considers whether a new understanding of publics can emerge that protects our recognition of difference even as it focuses on shared experiences, and whether the concept of diversity has strength enough to support this. \n  \nSpeaker: \nRuth Fincher is Redmond Barry Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Melbourne.  She has held the Chairs of Urban Planning (1997 – 2006) and Geography (2007-2015) at the University of Melbourne.  She is a Board member of the International Social Science Council and a past Vice President of the International Geographical Union. \nAn urban geographer with research and teaching interests in the urban outcomes of immigration and multiculturalism, diversity and difference in cities, inequality and locational disadvantage, Professor Fincher is widely published internationally and has supervised many PhD students. Her writings include the books Planning and Diversity in the City: Redistribution, Recognition and Encounter, co-authored with Kurt Iveson (Palgrave Macmillan, London. 2008).

Meanwhile new technologies such as containerisation with Docker and similar tools or buzzwords like DevOpsBiz have burst onto everyone's radar, prompting experts in both development and operations something to re-examine how they do business. \nWorking out how to make the most of these new theories and techniques is essential for your organisation’s success. \nContinuous Lifecycle London will bring together all the relevant parties, to help to reveal the potential and scope out the obstacles ahead of time.

The South as a state of mind, rather than a place or a (more or less expanded) canon. Journeys with Frantz Fanon and Alicia Garza as pioneers in the ‘southing’ of the mind and situated fighters; with Lewis R. Gordon as jazz drummer, chief thinker of our time and author of \"What Fanon Said\"; to celebrate Paget Henry’s own journeys at his 70th birthday; and Gail Lewis for being Gail Lewis. Of Grammatology’s 40-year journey with Gayatri Spivak, but also her, her journey, life, and lifework as an exemplar and figure for those of us bent on decolonising Critical Theory and criticalizing the Decolonial.  \nWe would like you to join us for a historical, visual, philosophical, musical and poetic journey through mondialisation and its forms of de-specification and institutional establishment.   Speakers include: Alicia Garza; Lewis R. Gordon (University of Connecticut); Paget Henry  (Brown University); Gail Lewis (Birkbeck, University of London); Nina Power (Roehampton University/Birkbeck, University of London); Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (Columbia University).  \nOn both days the conference will be followed by a video art session at the Birkbeck Cinema. This is a smaller venue than the conference so separate booking is essential. Tickets will be allocated on a first come, first served basis. \nMore information & booking for the video art session on 20 May. \nMore information & booking for the video art session on 21 May. \nImage courtesy of Emory Douglas.

    "description": "UCL Urban Laboratory is pleased to announce that influentual reggae poet and recording artist Linton Kwesi Johnson will deliver the 2016 Cities Imaginaries Annual Lecture. \nWidely regarded as the father of dub poetry, Linton Kwesi Johnson is an influentual commentator on twentieth and twenty-first century British experience, specifically of the Afro-Carribean communities that populate major cities. Born in 1952 in Chapelton, Jamaica. He moved to London in 1963 to be with his mother and went on to read Sociology at Goldsmiths, University of London.   \nJohnson is only the second living poet to be published in the Penguin Modern Classic Series, and in 2005 he was awarded a Musgrave medal by the Institute of Jamaica, for eminence in the field of poetry. Currently residing in Brixton, Johnson will read from a number of his poems.  \nCities Imaginaries was launched in 2014 with an inaugural lecture by the internationally acclaimed writer Amit Chaudhuri. The aim of the programme is to curate and create cultural representations of cities and urban life through screenings, salons, exhibitions, performances, workshops and other events. The programme is run by Dr Matthew Beaumont. ",

Spiralling property prices, limited housing stock and a rapidly-growing population are making it increasing difficult for Londoners to find a place to live. Home ownership has become accessible only to the wealthiest, and rented accommodation is under enormous pressure, offering substandard or prohibitively expensive options that offer no long-term security.    What can be done to address London’s housing crisis? Does the current policy debate offer the right answers? Who are the key stakeholders and how can they work together to deliver solutions?  UCL Grand Challenges and UCL Public Policy are hosting a ‘Question Time’ event on London’s housing crisis ahead of the Mayoral election, bringing together stakeholders from public policy, the private sector, NGOs and others to consider the most pressing housing issues for London and potential solutions. \nChaired by Peter Wynne Rees CBE (UCL Professor of Places and Planning, and former City of London Planning Officer), the panel will include Duncan Bowie (University of Westminster), Alice Martin (new economics foundation), Austen Reid (Circle Housing), and June Barnes (Board member, Urban & Civic property developers). \nFollowed by a drinks reception.

    "description": "UCL Inaugural Lectures 2015-16 \n  \nProfessor Marcos Martinón-Torres, UCL Institute of Archaeology \n  \nArchaeology, Science and Serendipity \n  \nMany of the most important archaeological discoveries are now made in scientific laboratories, to the extent that modern archaeology cannot be imagined without science. However, this does not mean that archaeologists should just research and write like scientists. Indeed, the empire of a narrowly understood scientific method may sometimes be acting as a straitjacket for truly ground-breaking research in science and archaeology alike. \nThis lecture will present a superficial and highly personal account of some archaeological research projects spanning from the Terracotta Army in China through the laboratories of alchemists in Europe, and up to the sacred lakes in the Colombian highlands. In all cases, science has been key to unlocking archaeological mysteries. In turn, this work also reminds us that truths are often relative, and that alternative ways of learning, developing and communicating science and technology are possible. \nThis lecture will be followed by a drinks reception. \n\n  \nMarcos Martinón-Torres received degrees in history, archaeology and archaeological science, before completing his PhD on the archaeology of alchemy and chemistry at UCL in 2005. He then joined the UCL Institute of Archaeology as a Lecturer, taking on the co-ordination of an MSc in archaeological science that has trained students from over 20 countries. He is interested in the interplay between archaeology, science and history, and in the study of materials and technologies in different contexts. His research spans numerous projects throughout Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, many in collaboration with more than 20 PhD students under his supervision, and leading to several international awards. He has authored more than 100 publications and delivered approximately as many talks to all kinds of audiences in some 20 countries, besides making frequent contributions to mass media. He is associate editor for the Journal of Archaeological Science and sits on several editorial and charity boards. ",

How that stuff in your head enables you to see, hear and think about the world around you, make decisions and act on them? Join six leading brain scientists to explore what we know about \"the most complicated kilo of matter in the universe\". \nThe day will be chaired by psychologist and presenter of BBC Radio 4's All in the Mind, Claudia Hammond. \n  \nSpeakers: \n-  Morten Kringelbach   \nAssociate professor and senior research fellow at the University of Oxford and professor of neuroscience at Aarhus University, Denmark. Professor Kringelbach specialises in studying pleasure, and the lack of it, in the human brain. He is co-author of Emotion: Pleasure and Pain in the Brain \n-  Mary Morrell \nProfessor of sleep and respiratory physiology at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London. Professor Morrell is an expert on breathing disorders during sleep and has researched their impact on faculties such as memory \n-  Andrew Jackson \nWellcome Trust senior research fellow at the Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University. Dr Jackson worked on a neural prosthesis to restore hand movement after spinal injury, and is helping to create a brain implant to control epilepsy \n-  Peggy St Jacques \nLecturer in psychology and memory researcher at the University of Sussex. Dr St Jacques' unit studies memory retrieval and how it provides an opportunity to update, enhance, and sometimes distort our recollections \n-  George Mather \nProfessor of vision science at the University of Lincoln and director of research in the College of Social Sciences. Professor Mather specialises in the perception of movement and of visual art.

In 1819, the radical thinker and surgeon William Lawrence put it like this: \"It is strongly suspected that a Newton or Shakespeare excels other mortals only… by having an extra inch of brain in the right place.\" \nToday, many such suspicions are certainties. We understand the structures of the brain, minor and major, and their roles in making us who we are. We can record electrical signals from individual brain cells or networks of them. Imaging technology lets us see both snapshots of the brain and also videos of it in action. We can follow connections within the brain and watch them reform after an injury. \nThis event will introduce you to the evolution and anatomy of the brain. We will view it through traits such as: memory, emotions, sleep, sensing and perception. We'll also investigate techniques for controlling the brain using electric and magnetic fields, as well as the latest technologies that allow you to control the outside world using your mind alone.  \nThis event will stop short of dealing with consciousness, though it will undoubtedly be mentioned. Consciousness is for another day… \n  \nTopics covered will include: \n\nEvolution and anatomy of the brain\nHow memory makes us human\nEmotion\nSleep and the brain\nSensing and perception\nBrain-computer interfaces - towards neural implants\n\n  \nWho should attend? \nYou are curious about how your brain works. Popular articles have whetted your appetite, yet you have struggled to understand the textbooks. You want to learn about the frontiers of research from scientists at the coalface. \n  \nWhat's included: \n\nEngaging talks from 6 leading experts on the brain\nAsk-an-expert Question Time session\nYour chance to meet the speakers and host Claudia Hammond\nBuffet lunch, plus morning and afternoon refreshments\nExclusive Instant Expert certificate\nExclusive New Scientist subscription deal, book and merchandise offers\n\n  \nBooking information: \n\nThe event will be held in the Brunei Auditorium at RCGP / 30 Euston Square.\nDoors to the Auditorium will open at 9:15am, talks will commence at 10am sharp.

    "description": "Join us for three action-packed days of discussions and screenings exploring the relationship between Shakespeare and Indian cinema, the world's largest cinema industry. We’ll be bringing together some of the most interesting minds working on Shakespeare today to establish what exactly is happening in India when it comes to the Bard – and what the Bard can tell us about India in turn. Below we have picked out several highlights. The full list can be accessed here.  \n27th April 2016 15.45 – 17:15  \nTalk - Shakespeare Meets Bollywood: The Bhardwaj Trilogy \nJoin top Bollywood director Vishal Bhardwaj as he discusses his Indian Shakespeare trilogy Maqbool, Omkara and Haider with his scriptwriters Abbas Tyrewala (Maqbool), Robin Bhatt (Omkara) and Basharat Peer (Haider). In an event chaired by Shakespeare expert Dr Varsha Panjwani, the four will discuss how they have been able to translate the 17th Century writings of Shakespeare into the context of contemporary India. \n28th April 2016 13:30 – 15:00  \nTalk - The Hungry: The New Titus Andronicus \nIntroducing some of the team behind The Hungry, the new Indian Titus Andronicus set to begin shooting later this year. Writer and academic Dr Preti Taneja will introduce the event, followed by a Q&A chaired by Film London Head of Talent Development and Production, Deborah Sathe. Come and meet Kurban Kassan (producer, Cinestaan), Briony Hanson (Head of Film, British Council) and Tessa Inkelaar (VP International Development Cinestaan), find out about the film's ambitions and the place of Shakespeare on film in India-British relations. Hear more about the Microwave International production scheme and the development process which led to Film London and the British Council working with Cinestaan on this exciting UK/India co-production. \n15:15 – 16:45  \nScreening - 10 ml Love: Indian Midsummer Night’s Dream Shakespeare goes indie   \nThe young and upcoming director, Sharat Katariya, transforms Shakespeare’s most popular play according to the edgy Indian indie aesthetics. This 2012 romcom moves from the magical forest setting of A Midsummer Night’s Dream to the urban jungle of Mumbai where Oberon and Titania are aphrodisiac sellers. Like the original though expect lots of humour and love triangles. \n29th April 13:00 – 15:45  \nScreening: Kaliyattam \nFirst shown in 1997, this acclaimed adaptation of Shakespeare's Othello revolves around Kannan Perumalayan, a Theyyam artist who parallels Othello, and Thamara, the beautiful daughter of a village head in Kerala. The film went on to scoop up Best Actor for Suresh Gopi (Kannan) and Best Director for Jayaraaj at India’s National Film Awards. We will be joined by Jayaraaj, who will take part in a Q&A at the film’s end, led by Thea Buckley. \n  ",

Co-Head of Hermes EOS Engagement Hermes Equity Ownership Services Ltd) Robin Brooks (Partner Norton Rose Fulbright) \nChair: Dr Iris Chiu (University College London) \nTuesday 19 April 2016, 6pm \nUCL Pearson (North East Entrance) G22 LT Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT \n  \nAbout the talk: \n  \nThere is increasing pressure on businesses to take steps to ascertain, manage and account for their human rights impacts and explain how they are doing this. At national level, legislation has been enacted in several jurisdictions aimed at increased transparency through reporting on human rights issues. Examples include the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the UK Modern Slavery Act. Besides, the EU Directive on non-financial reporting has brought mandatory human rights reporting to large companies in the EU. Commercial practice is showing that not all commercial organisations are aware of their obligations to report and those which are aware are not sure about the areas in their business and their supply chains which should be covered and the extent to which they should consider making disclosures.  \nThe UCL Centre for Ethics and the Law has assembled an expert panel to discuss these topical issues. We hope to provide an opportunity for companies, lawyers, investors and academics to engage with the issues and challenges regarding the reporting requirements on business and human rights \n  \nAbout the speakers \n  \nAnna Triponel is an international lawyer specialized in advising companies, their in-house legal departments, law firms and investors on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. She advises and trains leading companies from a range of sectors on best practices for embedding responsible business practices, including human rights risk management, throughout their operations, and law firms on integrating corporate responsibility into legal practice. Anna is a director at Triponel Consulting Ltd and a project associate at Shift. She played a leading role in the development of the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. Anna previously served as legal consultant with the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, providing input into the work of Professor John Ruggie to develop the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. \n  \nDr Hans-Christoph Hirt is Co-Head and a board member at Hermes EOS, and responsible for the sustainable success of the business. As Co-Head he leads and oversees the global engagement programme and the quality of the services Hermes EOS provides to its clients around the world. Hans also leads some high profile stewardship activities, including priority engagements with major companies in Asia and Germany, as well as interactions with key regulators and organisations. Prior to joining Hermes EOS, Hans worked with the international law firm Ashurst. He is the author of numerous publications on corporate governance and law, responsible investment and stewardship. Currently, he is a member of the Steering Committee of the UN PRI Investor Engagement Clearinghouse and the Shareholder Responsibilities Committee of the International Corporate Governance Network. In 2015, he joined the Institutional Investor Council in Malaysia. Hans is a UK-qualified lawyer, holds degrees in Business Administration from universities in Germany and the UK, the ACCA qualification and a PhD from the London School of Economics (LSE). He continues to be involved in academia as a Corporate Governance Fellow at the LSE’s Financial Markets Group and a Teaching Fellow at University College London. Hans speaks French, German and Mandarin. \n  \nRobin Brooks is a corporate finance lawyer based in London with over 35 years’ experience of international transactions and advisory work. In recent years he has focused on governance and ethical issues and has participated in a number of significant investigations and risk assessments around the world, including Norton Rose Fulbright’s advice to the Board of TeliaSonera AB in relation to certain of its Eurasian investments. He has advised on ethical implications of a number of M&A transactions. Robin is a member of the Law Society of England and Wales and the City of London Solicitors’ Company. Recently he has been involved in the development of Norton Rose Fulbright's training in relation to M&A and in particular training for transactions involving difficult jurisdictions with a particular focus on human rights related issues. He regularly talks on ethical issues relating to international transactions and is a keen supporter of organisations dedicated to the support for Human Rights.   \nAbout the Centre: \nUCL Centre for Ethics & Law was established in 2009 to reflect the growing need for enhanced collaboration between academics, practicing lawyers and industry, given the fast changing and increasingly interdisciplinary nature of the global issues lying at the intersection between ethics and regulatory compliance. The work of the Centre is resolutely multi-disciplinary and practice-oriented, focusing on a number of current themes including the professional ethics of in-house and external legal counsel, ethics of risk, anti-corruption, global business and human rights, and distributive justice.

    "description": "Trauma and Harm Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities in collaboration with Louise Hide, Joanna Bourke and Ana Antic, Department of History, Classics and Archaeology, Birkbeck, University of London.  \nSpeaker: Professor Allan Young, Marjorie Bronfman Professor in Social Studies in Medicine at McGill University Date: Thursday 14 April Time: 6pm-7.30pm \nIn this presentation Professor Young will describe configurations of harm associated with the diagnosis, treatment, and management of mental trauma affecting two contemporary clinical populations: American war veterans from 1980 to the present time and former child soldiers. He will focus on clinical efforts aimed at convincing individuals to re-experience or re-think memories of the experiences believed to be responsible for their continuing symptomatic distress. According to some critics and former patients, these same therapeutic procedures painfully re-traumatize the already traumatized patients. He will concentrate on two procedures: prolonged exposure therapy, regarded by the US National Center for PTSD as the ‘gold standard’ for the treatment of war-related PTSD, and narrative exposure therapy, a briefer and superficially similar approach that is employed for the treatment of child soldiers and others. These procedures, and the associated proofs of efficacy and familiar tropes (notably ‘trauma’ and ‘harm’), are embedded in a dense web of moral meanings and confusions.  \nAllan Young is an anthropologist and the Marjorie Bronfman Professor in Social Studies in Medicine at McGill University, Montreal. His current research focuses on the ethnography of psychiatric science, specifically the valorization of (new) diagnostic and therapeutic technologies and the institutionalization of standards of evidence; and the ethnography of psychogenic trauma as a clinical entity and as a subject of laboratory and epidemiological research. He has published widely and is the author of The Harmony of Illusions: Inventing Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995). ",
