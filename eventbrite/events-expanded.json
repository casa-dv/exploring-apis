And what was the relationship between these polities and those remained outside their control? The earliest agrarian states were small and fragile. More people lived outside them than within. They were subject to internal fracture, abandonment, and raiding\u2014both sporadic and systematic. They also represented valuable trade depots that enhanced the exchange value of products from non-state ecologies. The result was, for a time at least, what one might call a \u201cgolden age of barbarians.\u201d \nJames C.

At national level, legislation has been enacted in several jurisdictions aimed at increased transparency through reporting on human rights issues. Examples include the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the UK Modern Slavery Act. Besides, the EU Directive on non-financial reporting has brought mandatory human rights reporting to large companies in the EU.

Co-Head of Hermes EOS Engagement Hermes Equity Ownership Services Ltd) Robin Brooks (Partner Norton Rose Fulbright) \nChair: Dr Iris Chiu (University College London) \nTuesday 19 April 2016, 6pm \nUCL Pearson (North East Entrance) G22 LT Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT \n\u00a0 \nAbout the talk: \n\u00a0 \nThere is increasing pressure on businesses to take steps to ascertain, manage and account for their human rights impacts and explain how they are doing this. At national level, legislation has been enacted in several jurisdictions aimed at increased transparency through reporting on human rights issues. Examples include the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the UK Modern Slavery Act. Besides, the EU Directive on non-financial reporting has brought mandatory human rights reporting to large companies in the EU. Commercial practice is showing that not all commercial organisations are aware of their obligations to report and those which are aware are not sure about the areas in their business and their supply chains which should be covered and the extent to which they should consider making disclosures.  \nThe UCL Centre for Ethics and the Law has assembled an expert panel to discuss these topical issues. We hope to provide an opportunity for companies, lawyers, investors and academics to engage with the issues and challenges regarding the reporting requirements on business and human rights \n\u00a0 \nAbout the speakers \n\u00a0 \nAnna Triponel is an international lawyer specialized in advising companies, their in-house legal departments, law firms and investors on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
